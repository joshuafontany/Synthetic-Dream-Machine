# GOING PLACES

Rainbowlands adventures are about "going there and back again" without needing to dwell on researching, booking, outfitting, and packing for travel. We want to unfold the big map, move the party token and plant a flag at each new location. This section provides rules to turn cash into character options, an overview of travel modes, and some generators to make travel a game while visiting the Circle Sea's mad locations (The Garden & The Vast, pXX).

## TICKET DICE

You’re not interested in how an atomic train runs or how to properly stow cargo in an airship’s sinewy hold. You’re a genteel tourist of taste and, purportedly, means! That’s why we’re introducing three flavors of **six-sided ticket dice**.

### **Comfort Dice**

When you need pampering. Each comfort die provides +1 temporary life after a good night’s sleep. You may also permanently spend a comfort die to:

1. Reroll a defeat roll. Your hearty breakfast cushioned that blow.
2. Take a short rest, then recover 1d6 x 2 life.
3. Take a long rest, then remove an extra burden _and_ gain 1d6 temporary life.
4. Acquire a civilized item, such as a nice suit or comfy pillow.

### **Protection Dice**

When you need insurance. Each protection die provides +1 to saves against damage to you or your property. You may also permanently spend a security die to:

1. Reroll a reaction roll. Your armature may frighten off would-be attackers.
2. Turn an enemy's critical hit into a regular hit.
3. Wait 1d4 days, then receive a copy of a lost item (terms and conditions apply).
4. Acquire a combat item.

### **Speed Dice**

When you need to go-go. Each speed die provides a +1 to chases and races. You may also permanently spend a speed die to:

1. Avoid an encounter before rolling reactions.
2. Roll initiative a 2nd time and get an extra turn this round.
3. Safely escape a fight or catch someone who got away.
4. Acquire an alternate means of transport or travel, such as a drug mule or bicycle.

### BUYING TICKET DICE

You buy a **ticket for your week’s travel** in advance. Pricier tickets tend to give more dice. Choose dice types at purchase. Dice cannot be changed after your journey begins. All prices per caput.

|*Price*|**Type**|**Dice**|**Conveyances**|

## VOYAGE EVENTS

In the opening adventure, you got to talking with your fellow travelers. Who, how, why, what, where, when. But this is not the only thing that can happen.

Every week of voyaging, **roll for an event**. The referee may come up with their own events, too.

### FOOT, HOOF, OR PEDAL

Upon the Given World most humans travel by walking, swimming, and flight, as they have since the divine glory of the first MKR machine generated the first humans into this First of All Possible Worlds.

Some humans, dissatisfied with their basic design, use magical machines to carry cargo, venture into the void, or speed swifter than sound. Traditionalists harrumph at this hubris. Some barbarians, ignorant of the common panhumanity of sentience, enslave creatures to serve them. Beasts of burden, combat chargers, even domestic daemons.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Gore. A gruesome scene. Scattered on dawn's highway. An accident? [-1 aura and a burden of horror]|Accident. A collision, a road collapse? [-1d6 life and a random item is destroyed or save vs. serious injury]|Monster (L7, absorbing abomination). This thing ... was it ever human? [worth €1d6* x 100 as a trophy]|
|2|Sore. The hard path. [-1 agility]|Injured. A bad sprain, a pulled muscle? [-1d3 life and -2 agility]|Infected. Stonefoot spores, feral land coral? [slowed, -3 agility, +2 endurance]|
|3|Tired. The long path. [-1d4 life]|Delayed. Boisterous officialdom or mere weather? [+1d4 days]|Closure. The angel bids you take another path. [+1 week or defiance?]|
|4|Bored. Reveal something about yourself to your companions.|Robbed. As you slept. Chase the thief? [lose a random valuable item]|Bandits (L2, feral or barbarian). An ambush? A roadblock? [pay 1d3 items]|
|5|Amused. This is why the slow road is better! [+1d4 bonus life]|Companionship. A potential friend walks with you. [charisma to recruit]|Shrine. Revelation through erosion! [oldtech site, artefact and €1d4* x 100]|
|6|Informed. Who did you meet? What do they reveal about your destination? [gain [+a] to one roll]|Blessed. An automatic pilgrim, an electric monk? [+1 bonus hero die or +1 bonus to one ability]|Help. A healer or a mentor? [remove one burden or a study opportunity]|

### AUTOGOLEM, HAULER RIG, METAL STEED, OR VECH

True, it is tradition that all civilized humans are made with the right to freely journey using vehicles of their own craft Fortunately, few have either the skills or patience to build conveyances more advanced than a scooter or bicycle.

Machine-made oldtech vehicles were long taboo, marked by the red octagon of agency and restricted to holy servants. Folk tales of foolish youths hacking red-coded vehicles to perform "joy coups" often end with corrective reformatting. Today, the lack of functioning oldtech is a bigger problem. Remaining mechanical vehicles are prized, pampered, and often prayed into full golemic sentience.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Bang! Blown tire, fractured casket, escaped spirit? [+1d4 days or -€1d100]|Bang, bang! Pot shots! Bandit ghosts? Monsters? Falschers? [-1d8-1 life and save or the vehicle is damaged]|Road Hunter (L9, mad autogolem). Steel, thunder, plasma lances. [trophy worth €1d6* x 1,000]|
|2|Rattled. Shaken, battered, numbed. What terrible seats. [-1 endurance]|Cramped. Contorted, distorted, reshaped? [-2 strength or mutation]|Mind borrowed. Vehicle awakens with a copy of your ba. [uh, what the?]|
|3|Irradiated. By engine, sun, or shifting time. [-1 charisma or aura]|Thump. Was it a corpse before you hit it? [loot €1d6 x 20 or bury the body?]|Barricade. Militia [L2] seeks the Road Hunter. [+1 week or 1d3 weapons]|
|4|Numbed. Something that bothered you fades. [remove 1 mental burden]|Overcharged. Spirit fuel shouldn't cost this much! [+1 week or -€2d4* x 20]]|High. The fuel fumes? [burden of elevation and +1d4 life]|
|5|Surprised. Living roadside attraction! [€1: gain +1d6 bonus life or an insight]|Hitchhiker. Strange roadside human. [1-in-6 actually a phylake (L6, judge)]|Restored motel. Not a mimic! [+1 day and -€1d6* x 10 to restore 2 attributes]|
|6|Easy Ride. Share a hard discovery about you or your society. [-1d2 days]|Holy lubricants. Permanent vehicle bonus. Thanks, gas priests! [d6: (1–4) it gains +1d4 life, (5–6) it gains +1 level]|Wise golem. A mechanic and teacher. [repair one machine or an oldtech study opportunity]|

### BUS, GONDOLA, POD, RAIL, TUBE, OR WIRE

Public intersanctuary transport was a blessing given to approved managers and tourists by the Good Gods in the Long Long Ago. Living buses and atom trains and wire golems and pod floaters and more they gifted the humans for their certified travel needs. Alas, time has had its way and now anyone with the cash to spare may board one of the public transporters, whether a holy fool or casteless feral or a fiscally fallen noble.

Cheap, slow, and raucous, the public intersanctuary transport system even yet attracts some tourists.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Fight! Other travelers' fists fly. Bottles are drawn (L1, lubricated). [save or you, too]|Impact. Something (L7, scary) under the bus. [-1d4 life and a random item comes alive with an alien spirit]|Ambush. Falscher barbarians (L4, eerie) or electric nomads (L5, zapping). [your € or your priciest item or your life]|
|2|Broken. Cubist chairs, cruel corridors. [-2 agility or strength]|Dead. Thankfully, insurance. But who pulled your plug? [+1 week and -€50]|Modified. A foreign subroutine in your soul? [+1 aura and a ticking trait]]|
|3|Sleepless. Two nights required.|Tax. Official local inspection.|Partly digested. The vessel is hungry|
|4|[suffer 2 burdens, sleep fixes it] Itchy. Lice or mice or seat bugs?|[+1d4 days and -€5 or just -€20] Breakdown. Disembark and walk?|[lose a limb or 1d3 items] Ventilation cough. Wheezy, metallic.|
|5|[suffer 1 burden, remove with a bath] Delayed. Not unexpected.|[+2d6 days] Donations. Or listen to the word.|[burden of disease] Valuable heirloom. Someone lost it,|
|6|[+1d4 days] Friends. Share drinks and dreams and one will help. [level 1d4, 1d3 skills]|[-€1d6* x 5 or -1 aura and +1 day] Secret voices. The spirit of travel.

### CARGOSPACE & INTERSANCTUARY EXPRESS

At the dawn of time the Lords equipped the human sanctuary settlements with expresses—a system of magimagnetic vacuum tubes and capsules to move cargo and suspended humans from station to station at speed. Humans traveled in suspension as cargospace is very hazardous to human well-being.

Few moderns now retain the access blessing to travel in suspension, so the intersanctuary express is used almost exclusively for authority-approved cargo. The ingenious humans of these later times use the anti-entropic outer shell of the express as the main highway round the Circle Sea co-prosperity area—the Right Road. Golem buses, solar tricycles, and personal velocipedes abound.

**Access Blessing One — Autosoma**

_Unlock Medical Buildertech, Sacred Pod Charm_

**P:** 2 **R:** nearby **T:** auld meditech **D:** hours

Code daemons in your blood speak to the oldtech and announce you as a hereditary "duck mountain prominence". Control healing machinery without the risk of mutations or degradation. Access suspension capsules. Use cold storage as a one-way time machine.
**Overcharge:** the healing oldtech deals damage instead.
**Note:** you can only store this power in human tissue—in yourself (as a trait) or in a suitable anchor, such as the mummified hand of Dr. N. A. Vec.

|*#*|**1–4 CARGOSPACE (COMMON)**|**5–6 CARGOSPACE (RARE)**|**αΩ CARGOSPACE (AWAKE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Nightmares. A thousand lifetimes of anguish and horror. [suffer 2 burdens]|Body stolen. Now a synthetic copy. [permanent: -1d3 life, +1 ability score]|Spiritwipe. You now need to eat souls to live. [you have no aura]|
|2|More lives. You saw copies of yourself in the Long Ago. [+1d4 life]|Replaced. Died and swapped under warranty. [permanent: +1 life]|Hard rays. Glowing and translucent. [-2 physical, +1 mental ability scores]|

### THE WATERS: BATEAU, FERRY, GLISSEUR, OR YACHT

Many rightly humans fear the waters, for they represent that portion of the world given to the cetaceans by the gods. As the old song goes, the sea is a desert with its life underground and an azure disguise above. Restricted from fishing and aquaculture by the pelagic phylakes and alien cetaceans, few traditionalists see much use for the salty watery expanse. Indeed, they would be hard-pressed to see much difference between commercial clans, hexad high-liners, polybody pirates, and feral ferryfolk.

For the traveler, there certainly are differences. For one thing, reputable seafolk won't steal your body.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Flotsam. A dead bateau. Scattered wreckage. [-1 aura and a random item]|Hell gull. The bird mugged you! [lose random item or -1d6 life]|Castaway (L6, body-hopper). An ultra or a time-lost wanderer? [€5k bounty]]|
|2|Seasick. The stomach rebels. [-1 endurance]|Seaworm (L2, unaesthetic). A nasty parasite. Remove it before it grows.|Great wave. A holy mountain shimmers behind. [-1 strength and endurance|
|3|Squall. Rain, thunder, waves, wind. [1d3 random items get wet]|[-1d4 life or -1 charisma per week] Storm. Blown off course, you dock at another port. [+1d10 days]|then save to gain a helpful spirit vision] Breach. The work of the cetaceans? [+1d4 days then save or shipwrecked]|
|4|Fine dolls. Cetacean emissaries track your vessel. [+1 bonus charisma].|Whale killers. They sell mystery meat. [€5, restores 1 attribute]|Undines (L10, moody, pale). They hunt the killers. [trade truths for luck]|
|5|Exercised. Ions in the air recharge you. [+1 bonus hero die]|Floating chest. Can it be that old? [random item but save or cursed]|Ghost ship. Looks seaworthy! [haunted but worth €1d4* x 1,000]|
|6|Relaxed. The sea airs are medicinal [benefit from a long rest]|Soothed. Partake of leaked cetacean dreams [remove all mental burdens]|Contact. A cetacean speaks to you. [will teach friends aquatic traits]|

### THE AIRS: BLIMP, FLAPPER, PROPELLEUR, OR RUG

Traditional, god-fearing stories say humans are barred from the heavens. That demons and deities claim those high places as their own. That nothing save thin air and dry decay await beyond the protective embrace of Mother Soil and the nurturing guidance of Father Rain. So many of these stories align that there are castes of scholars convinced they were constructed from a single template. This could not be, for it would imply some force or organization meddling with human myth on a grand scale!

In any case, air travel is too expensive and dangerous for ordinary humans and the nobles and scions who may be expected to regularly fly like birds between one city and another cannot be expected to face the same barriers as the less divine orders of humanity.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Stuckforce! Detour to avoid the razor fields. [+1d6 days or save or crash]|Long Ago force bullet. [save or lose d6: (1–4) an item or (5–6) a limb]|Razorstorm. Long Long Ago forces whip the air. [save or crash and lose a thing]|
|2|Blinded. By the unhazed light of the upper air. [burden lasts 1d6 days]|Mirrorforce. Shard seeks eye. [save or gain burden: all looks evil]|Devisions. Gremlins infest your optics. [-1 thought and burden: hallucinations]|
|3|Riders (L2, solar nomads) on the storm. [pay a random item as a guide fee or risk a storm: 1-in-6, see rare]|Aerolith island. It is d6: (1) cursed, (2) infested, (3) mutating, (4) abandoned, (5) fresh, (6) settled.|Killer air whale (L7, angelic). Seeks live food or undead fun. [aerolith-infused bones worth €7k]|
|4|Airsick. Too little oxygen? Too much aether? [-1 thought or strength]|Heavy haze. Go slow or get lost. [+1d4 days or save or fly off course]|Green sunburn. Moss blooms on skin. [lose -1d4 attributes, gain +1d8 life]|
|5|Air plankton bloom. Harvest time! [+1d4 days to gather supplies]|Noble creatures (L4, grazing pod). Feel uplifted. [restore 1 lost attribute]|Fair angel (L6, harsh). Reads your mind and soul. [save to prove you are good]|
|6|Sundogs. Bless these rad puppies! [+1d6 life for powers]|Lost prayers. Pre-approved. [sing to remove 1 burden]|Dragon (L13, alien). It offers solace. [randomly replace a trait or item]|

### THE VOID: BOLIDE, CHARIOT, SPHERE, OR VOIDSKIFF

Modern, civilized humans do not travel to the stars, fast or slow. There is nothing there for the status-conscious. However, those strange outcasts, those voidwalkers who claim to have been there, say many divine machines still sail the dry void. Others say secret portal codes unlock strange places far above the Soil. Then there are the strange dehumans who say they climbed down the Ladder of Heaven itself. What is this, if not mere monkey-tosh?

One thing is sure: humans exposed to the void, beyond the airs of the Given World, desiccate swiftly and totally. Rehydration is expensive (€1d6* x 200) and best performed in a registered meditechnical temple.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Hulk. A void vessel from Long Long ago, full of dehydrated protohumans. [enter: -1 endurance and horror]|Horror. We are so small. Nothing. [once: permanently lose -1 aura, after: gain burden of cosmic terror]|The Eater (L17, demilyst). It obliterates because it must. [treasures orbit its maw, to acquire one: save or dissolve]|
|2|Cabin fever. There is nowhere to go. [save or lose 1 aura or thought]|War fever. The winds of limbo roar. [save or feel compelled to eat brains]|Gene memory. The shakes hit hard. [-2 agility and save: gain a psychic trait]|
|3|Voidsick. Odd vibrations afflict you. [-1 strength and save or mutate]|Hyperparticle. Losing air or spirit. [spend 1d3 items to repair or run out in 1d4 days and save or mutate]|Insight. We are so small. Rats in the cosmic corpse. [once: permanently gain +1 thought, after: gain 2 hero dice]|
|4|Astral flora. A sargasso of space kelp. [+1d4 days to harvest nutrients]|Protogolem. Its suspended mind, still human? [-1d6 life to restart]|Shell people (L3, soil-hungry). Surfing the void. [suspicious, but will trade]|
|5|Silence. No voices but your own. Share, bond, come together. [+1d4 life]|Ghosts. Voices from Long Ago. Follow them? [+2d4* days to reach source]|Another chariot. Exactly like yours. But abandoned. [duplicate an item]|
|6|Perspective. We are so small. Specks of dust. [once: permanently gain +1 charisma, after: remove 1 burden]|Recrudescence. Humans were made for the war. [gain +1 strength and an innate aggressiveness]|Interloper (L6, giant). It looks human, but stands 9 feet tall and wields buildertech. [devil? angel?]|

### THE PORTALS: DULL, FAST, ONE, SLOW, OR WILD

Portals have fascinated humans since prehistory. Some think them gifts from the Lords, others that they are the byproducts of ancient "Engineers." Many simply accept them as fundamental cosmic structures. These hard-coded passages between distinct locations form hub-and-spoke networks, with portal temples serving for central access.

The dullway protocol dismantles and reassembles travelers, with journey times and capacity varying based on the portal's information density and usage. Well-traveled routes between major institutions can transport up to a hundred people in hours, while smaller village portals may take months to handle a single traveler. To preserve human sanity, most travel gates were once equipped to run pocket realities for their travelers during point-to-point translation.

The Human Wellness Authority maintains that portal travel is completely safe. It claims side effects are very rare, mostly harmless, probably temporary, and the individual traveler's own fault. Nevertheless, most moderns fear this ancient technology, fearing it may steal their immortal motive sparks. This is not incorrect.

|*#*|**1–3 (COMMON)**|**4–5 (UNCOMMON)**|**6 (RARE)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Living tunnel. Wailing life-forms smeared into the length of the portal tunnel, enmeshed in its no-being. [save or they consume +1d6 days]|Human tunnel. Generations upon generations built into the walls of this ill reality. [save or join them for +1d4 weeks, then save or stay]|The Dull Worm (L15, waymaker). It connects because it can. [spend +1d4 weeks and 1 aura to find a new place; scavengers and terrors follow behind]|
|2|Blanking. Some memories disappear. [save or they were important]|Seepage. Some of you is lost. [lose -1 thought or aura]|Stripped. Soul milled. [save or become a flesh golem without aura]|
|3|Emesis. Please clean yourself up. [lose your last meal; hungry now]|Nosebleed. [d6: (1) a second mind enters you; (2–6) cosmetic only]|Illumination. [d6: gain (1-3) a glow, (4–5) a soul, (6) a grim purpose]|
|4|Existential dread. This place is not for humans. [alcohol-soluble burden]|Strange gasses. Burp discreetly. [ingest to levitate for 1d3 days]|Odd machines. They live inside you. [feed them power to gain knowledge]|
|5|Dull. The way is boring. It feels endless. [rethink a position]|Time. Time dilates. It is endless. [grow older and wiser, or the reverse]|Side. Walk besides yourself. [become more; add +1 to your best ability]|
|6|Invigorated. Imbibe the vim of the spaces in-between. [+1d6 life]|Euphoria. You're so happy you could explode. [gain a hero die]|Emptiness. The nothing sets you free. [remove 1 burden and gain +1 aura]|
