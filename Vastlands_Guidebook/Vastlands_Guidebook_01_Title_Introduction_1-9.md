# INTRODUCTION

Welcome, curious explorer, to the Vastlands. To a time beyond the end of time.

Here, in the heart of the world, is the Circle Sea, the pond of panhumanity surrounded by polychrome lands. This is _Our Golden_ _Age_ . An overgrown garden of humanity, here neat, there feral, sprawling out of sight of its absentee Builders, safely kept by the inscrutable might of its warden angels, the Phylakes.

There, to the west, the psychedelic _Ultraviolet Grasslands_ stretch beyond the edge of civilization and its faded histories, a deep, vast, mythic steppe littered with the detritus of time and space and memory.

The Vastlands are inspired by strange musics, unusual fictions, old games, flawed philosophies and many artists from Moebius to Miyazaki. They grow from the adventuring sessions of the Golden Goats in the mid 2010s. They are the work of artist and author Luka Rejec.

Safe travels at the end of time, beyond the edge of the last safe world.

```
They’re okay, the last days of May,
but I’ll be breathin’ dry air
I’m leaving soon, the others are
already there (All there...)
Wouldn’t be interested in coming
along instead of staying here?
It’s said the West is nice this time
of year, that’s what they say

—Then Came the Last Days of May,
Blue Öyster Cult (1972)
```

## PLAYER REFEREE RUNNER

This guidebook is for everyone at the table: the player who referees the game and the players who run the characters. Have fun and enjoy playing together.

**No Masters**

The referee is used as a neutral term for the player preparing the adventure, running the session, setting the beat for play, and balancing the spotlight between the other players. The referee is not a master — more like the bass player of the roleplaying table. They succeed when they make everyone shine.

**Anti-Canon**

No player, not even the referee, has to master all the lore. You’re on a journey together: discovering the world and what happens in it by the oracle of your dice. There is no canonic Vastlands. No true, proper way to play it. The game at your table belongs to you all. Through play, you create a world of your very own.

**Referee Titles**
To remind everyone that the referee is also a player, they can get a different title and playful power every session. Here are some ideas to get you started:
|#|Title|Session Powers|
|---|---|---|
|1|Boss Cat|All must acclaim the local house cat. Give extra xp for cat-themed treats.|
|2|The Cleaner|Award xp to players who help clean up after the session.|
|3|Electric Ghost|Summon a hero’s annoying ancestor ghost for advice or moral lessons.|
|4|Glitch Golem|Move a random location on the map. Swap place names.|
|5|Judging Muse|Give xp for good background music choices. Veto bad ones by group vote.|
|6|Nine Lifer|Grant up to nine extra life points to characters.|
|7|Prismatic Priest|Randomly recolor locations. Roll d6: (1) monochrome, (2) desaturated, (3) cool hues, (4) warm hues, (5) bright, harmonious colors, (6) a brutal riot of neon and day-glo.|
|8|Rail Plotter|Draw a visible path linking prepared locations. Players can choose to follow or ignore it.|
|9|Sky Bringer|Create dramatic weather effects in-game. No complaints about tired clichés allowed.|
|10|Snack Warden|Give 1d4 re-rolls to players who bring food or music.|

## **Given World**

A world begins when it emerges from the mists of time. So it is with the civilizations of the Rainbowlands, marking their counts from when the Long Ago ended and the Now began. Perhaps gods or daemons imagine they recall earlier beginnings, but that is not the cosmos mankind believes it knows.

These later humans, undisputed masters of the fertile lands around the Circle Sea, dwellers in the Eye of Creation, in the Garden of the Given World. They come forth in many shapes, colors, creeds, and faiths. They pile together unkempt technology and misremembered lore. They rule the settled lands under painted deities of ill-repute, safe in customs of infinite antiquity.

From the Violet bastion against the exotic sunset lands, where the Black City reigns and even the rays of the sun acquire skin-blistering properties, to the Saffron Gate into the lands of many sunrises, where the radiance of the Little Son has imperium. From the undine-thick seas to the void-scraping Ladder of Heaven where the Great Desiccator obtains.

All those worlds are theirs. They just haven’t quite gotten around to them. But they will. Surely? Any time. Soon?

Creation and destruction, an endless cycle, looped so many times the history’s become a fog. No apocalypse remains. No post comes anymore.

Eras upon eras, worlds upon worlds, like grains of sand upon the beach of cosmic awareness.

Optimism. Life. New beginnings from the primordial ooze of barbarism. From the planetary vents of life.

Again, again, again.

Rain falls on mountains. Streams become rivers. Lakes meet seas.

Tribes become cities. Prophets found kingdoms. Explorers cross horizons. Merchants bind cultures. Empires cross continents. Shamans ascend to the stars. Life spreads from fast star to slow star. Wanderers tunnel the wormways through the ever void.

All must come to pass in the infinite cosmoses.

Eternity eats the unwise.

There is more to the universe than this Circle Sea and the Ultraviolet

Grasslands so near to the little humans, the happy rats in the carcass of the great spacetime vessel who think themselves its captains.

## **Origins of a Setting**
The roots of the Given World are in the Rainbow Lands that grew collaboratively from the games I ran for the Golden Goats of Lausanne in the early to mid 2010s (thank you, good players, for those amazing adventures and delightful dinners). The published Vastlands are not quite the same as those in the long-ago games. They could not be. But, like all fine history, art, and wine, they rhyme.

The world took further shape in the long strange _Ultraviolet Grasslands_ trip I wrote for and with the heroes of the stratometaship, the Patreon supporters who made this whole adventure possible. In 2019, with the help of roughly 2,000 backers we crowdfunded the hardcover first edition. In 2023, following fan feedback, the revised second edition saw the light of the Big and the Little Suns. _Our Golden Age_ and this Guidebook then followed over the last few years, with several detours along the way. Perhaps we shall revisit some of those abandoned routes in the future, perhaps not. Still, they were worth it in the end. Now, welcome, and off we go!
