# CHARACTER CREATION

To experience the Vastlands you need at least one player character. In this chapter:

1. generate your level 1 character’s **ability scores**
2. generate a **background trait**
3. ... and a **path trait**
4. ... and a **free trait**
5. **equip** them
6. generate other **attributes**
7. give them a **motivation**
8. invest **experience**
9. and **name** them

Later, you can acquire other characters: pets, sidekicks, secondary PCs and more. Their adventures, their defeats and victories, are yours to chart.

##### OUR SHADOWY COMPANIONS

A group of exemplary... er... example characters joins us to illustrate how the rules and procedures work.

_Example: The referee Cat and the intrepid characters Noë, Onion, Safir, and others demonstrate how the rules work to lay_ _waste the best-laid plans of mice and houses. And humans._

The heroes sacrificed to the dice oracles are built using random rolls for ability scores—and possibly changed through the vagaries of play and interactions with arcane devices. Yours may have different attributes.

**Noë**

A wizard of the dark electronic arts. A scholar in search of the illsome mysteries of the never-mentioned war.
|strength|0|charisma|5|
|endurance|1|aura|4|
|agility|2|thought|5|

**Onion**

A merchant and wide-ranging traveler. A trickster with a coin in every sock and a soothing lie for every ear.
|strength|1|charisma|5|
|endurance|0|aura|0|
|agility|4|thought|3|

**Safir**

A fighter of the caravan-protecting sort. An exile from the Blue Lands with a bloodline prone to corruption.
|strength|5|charisma|0|
|endurance|4|aura|1|
|agility|3|thought|2|

**Cat**

Our referee, a mighty acolyte of the Ceiling Cat.

Hazeraiser (referee title)—open a travel portal for the heroes. Demand sacrifices at will.

Abilities represent the natural, inherent aptitudes of a character. They come in three colors (active, dynamic, static) and two flavors (mind and matter). PCs' ability scores are always 0 or higher. Human ability scores range from 0 to 5. Inhuman characters may have higher scores.

_**Alternative Generation 1:**_ roll d100 for each ability in order

1–30 0 unremarkable, mediocre, ordinary human ability

31–55 1 promising, useful, potential

56–75 2 talented, apt, good

76–90 3 gifted, masterful very good

91–99 4 excellent, amazing, preternatural

100 5 incredible, optimal, a pinnacle of human ability

_**Alternative Generation 2:**_ assign 7 points to your abilities as you like with a maximum of 3 in any one ability. This is the way of those who mistrust chaos.

→ _Next: generate your background trait (p14)._

**Static Abilities**

Resisting things. Body, matter, structure, form, persistence, courage, _ha_ .

The resolve and stamina to bear and withstand.

- **Aura** is the mental ability of

resilience in the face of fortune’s outrageous slings. It is not wisdom (that is a trait).

It may allow a character to use
powers beyond mortal ken
longer than usual.
- **Endurance** is the physical ability

of resistance.

How much pain and strain a character can take. How much staying power they have.

**Active Abilities**

Doing things. Fire, drive, energy, vigor, thrust, movement, _ka_ .

The will and force to dominate and overcome.

- **Charisma** is the mental ability

of divine fortune, luck and conviction.

It lets a character get their way and win arguments through sheer force of personality.

- **Strength** is the physical ability
of lifting bars, bending gates,
punching guards, throwing
rocks, and climbing ladders.

It also increases how much a character can carry.

##### 13

**Dynamic Abilities** Changing things. Psyche, intellect, change, dexterity, path, speed, _ba_ . The wit and flexibility to adapt and adjust.

- **Thought** is the mental ability
of absorbing, processing, and
manipulating information.
It is not education (that is a trait).

It also increases how many traits a PC can have.

- **Agility** is the physical ability
of speed and precision within
the character’s environment.

Dodging, aiming, manipulating, balancing, flexibility, and more. It provides a bonus to defense.

#### BACKGROUND TRAIT

Traits are the innate acquired and inherited qualities and characteristics that make a character unique. This includes characteristics such as backgrounds, professions, mutations, downloaded skill packages, implanted prosthetics, corruptions, and memorized powers.

Individual traits may provide various benefits, including community membership, skill modifiers to actions, social standing, specific mechanical benefits, and new game options.

You have **7 + thought** inventory slots for traits.

Each trait occupies a trait inventory slot. Other traits, items, and events can increase the number of trait slots.

At level 1 you **start with three traits** .

A level 0 character has two traits. Characters can choose to gain a new trait every time they level up.

**Trait Skill Modifiers** Choose the same trait multiple times to increase its skill modifier.

**Skilled** +3 bonus to rolls good enough to make a living

**Expert** +6 bonus to rolls good enough to teach

**Master** +9 bonus to rolls a rare master of this art

A trait selected multiple times does not take up additional trait slots. Note a trait’s bonus (+3 / +6 / +9) to track how many times you have selected it.

**Applying Trait Skill Modifiers** Trait descriptions list some situations where skill modifiers apply. Players and the referee can use dialogue and common sense to figure out if a trait could apply in a new or unexpected situation.

**Other Trait Benefits** If traits provide other benefits, note them. You may also invent or discover new benefits to existing traits through play. This is good.

**Inventing New Traits** Players and referees can make up new traits together. Any profession, quality, background, mutation, or space oddity that sounds fun is fair game.

→ _Next: pick a path trait (p16). This provides the adventuring_ _competence your random background trait may lack._

<!-- table insert failed -->
**Traditional Background Generator** Roll a few times to invent some reasonably traditional civilized Circle Sea backgrounds. You can mix-and-match columns. Keep one you enjoy and note it in a trait inventory slot along with its modifier (+3).

#### PATH TRAIT

Paths are compilations of traits that create archetypal characters.

Review and **choose a path** (or roll d6):

1–2 Path of the **Wizard**

3–4 Path of the **Traveler**

5–6 Path of the **Fighter**

**Not Classes**

Paths are not classes. You are not bound to one path. You can choose traits from any path, in any order, mixingand-matching as you level up.

**No Prerequisites**
Some traits complement one another, but you can pick
them in any order as you level up or otherwise acquire
##### new traits through play. If you want, you can even skip PATH OF THE WIZARD

the superbasic, number zero trait. A scholar who uses the old technologies.

0. **Wizard.** You call yourself a magus, maker, or mechanic. You are skilled at casting spells (using oldtech powers). Perhaps you just know how to read the manuals of Long Ago and the Zero-One codes?

**More Wizard Traits**

To interrogate, to learn, to master, perhaps to create:

1. **Burner.** Once per turn, you can spend an ability point to overcharge a power, regardless of its cost. 2. **Chronic.** Spend a hero die to use a second power this round.

3. **Exuberant.** Each of your life points is worth double when paying for powers. 4. **Mind Palace.** Memorize a number of powers equal to your level for free, ignoring inventory. Draw the memory palace on the back of your character sheet. 5. **Oblique Reality.** Spend one life or one hero die to deflect a power targeting you (or an adjacent target) to the left or the right (or up or down). 6. **Recast.** When your power fails or a target makes its save, you can use the power again for free. Once. Recharge your recast with a hero die.

→ _Next: generate your character’s free trait (p18)_

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _16_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 017 -->

##### PATH OF THE TRAVELER

A merchant focused on overland voyaging. A trickster?

0. **Traveler.** You call yourself a vagabond, a wanderer, the wind. You are skilled at managing a caravan, navigating with maps and stars and waypoints, making and concealing camps, finding water and food, and the etiquette of the vast open lands. You wield the marching staff and the dagger and the traditional rifle.

**More Traveler Traits**

To hear, to see, to convince, perhaps to lead:

1. **Escapist.** You’re skilled at being lucky. That’s a +3 bonus to all saves.

2. **Friends.** You can have a number of pets or sidekicks equal to your level who don’t take up the usual inventory slot. Draw a separate box to list your friends on your character sheet. 3. **Hunter.** Track, trap, and shoot game with bow, rifle, and javelin. Hide in the wilds, move unseen. When you shoot from ambush, your critical hits deal triple instead of double damage. Expert: x4; master: x5. 4. **Pleasant.** Charming conversation and an easy demeanor. You get people to like you. That’s +2 to reaction rolls. Expert: +4; master: +6. 5. **Pocketmaster.** Conceal a number of small objects equal to your level for free, ignoring inventory. A knife is small. 6. **Swift.** Once per turn, spend one life or one hero die to get one extra action this round.

→ _Next: generate your character’s free trait (p18)._

##### PATH OF THE FIGHTER

A caravan guard who wears armor and wields weapons.

0. **Fighter.** You call yourself a warden, warrior, or weaponmaster. You are skilled at using traditional weapons and armors; from knife to sword, blaster to rifle, chitin shield to buffer harness. Also, you are skilled at defense. That’s a +3 bonus to defense and attack. Expert: +6; master: +9.

**More Fighter Traits** To struggle, to fall, to rise, perhaps to succeed.

1. **Armiger.** Carry a number of weapons equal to your level for free, ignoring inventory. Draw a weapons box on the back of your character sheet. 2. **Defender.** You’re skilled at physical defense and all kinds of defensive equipment. Also, even if unar mored, gain a +3 armor bonus. Expert: +6 armor; master: +9 armor.

3. **Grit.** Gain 1 life per level and advantage when you roll endurance.

4. **Irresistible.** Every round you deal damage equal to your level to one foe you attacked, whether your attack roll hit or missed.

5. **Second Chance.** When you would fall to 0 life, you fall to 1 life instead. Once. Recharge second chance with a hero die.

6. **Terrifying.** You’re skilled at frightening people. That’s also a +2 bonus when breaking your foes’ morale. Expert: +4; master: +6.

→ _Next: generate your character’s free trait (p18)_

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _17_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 018 -->

#### FREE TRAIT

Level 0 characters start with 2 traits and gain one per level. Since PCs start at 1st level, they get a third trait. This trait can be another background or path trait, a trait from other sources, or even something you invented.

**Roll a Random Trait**

**d6 for background and path traits (58 options) or d10 to include corruption and other paths (~240 options)**

1–3 roll d40 on the background trait table (p14)

4 roll d6 on the wizard path trait table (p16)

5 roll d6 on the traveler path trait table(p17)

6 roll d6 on the fighter path trait table(p17)

7–9 roll d20 to determine another path (p114); then d6 on the corresponding trait table roll d6 to determine corruption intensity: (1) severe, (2–3) moderate, (4–6) mild; 10 (0) then d20 for the corresponding corruption trait column (p99)

**Choose a New Trait**

Choose any new trait you like. Either from the tables listed above or from other sources.

**Choose an Existing Trait and Become an Expert** When you select the same trait a second time, your trait’s skill modifier increases from +3 (skilled) to +6 (expert). Depending on the trait, expertise may provide additional benefits. Selecting a trait twice does not increase the number of trait inventory slots it occupies. As you progress further, you can select the same trait a third time, becoming a master and increasing its skill modifier to +9 (master).

**Invent a New Trait**

To create a new trait, discuss with the rest of the table:

1. Is it fun and evocative to roleplay?

2. Can you describe it with a short, memorable title?

3. Does it enhance rather than overshadow other characters?

4. Is it versatile enough for various situations?

Aim for vivid, specific concepts like “Anointed Gladiator” or “Desire Detective” over staid ones like “Wizard,” “Thief,” or “Fighter.” The referee helps fit the new trait to the table’s game and can rule certain traits off limits. If a trait proves problematic in play, discuss with other players and adjust as needed. Remember, retconning to improve the game experience is not a sin.

→ _Next: equip your character (p20)._

#### CHARACTER EQUIPMENT

Items are all the tools and treasures that expand a character’s abilities and possibilities. From a mundane wrench to a magitechnical spell anchor, from a suit of pleather armor to a biomechanical crab-head, all are items.

You have **7 + strength** inventory slots for items.

Each loose item or package occupies at least one item inventory slot. Other traits, items, and events can increase the number of item slots. Each item inventory slot is 1 stone in size.

**At level 1 you start with:**

One strange item of ill-disclosed origin (p22). One useful kit—a sack of quantum gear that fits your background (p23). Some starting cash. €100 to be exact (p23).

A level 0 character starts without the strange item and with just €50 cash. A higher level character starts with more cash.

→ _Now get that strange item (p22)._

##### HOW ITEMS WORK

**Sizes**

Item sizes in the Vastlands use abstract units that combine weight and bulk.

**size** **=** **Example**

1 sack 10 Basic cargo unit, about as much as a (sk) stones human.

**Available Items and Packed Items**

Available items take up at least one inventory slot each, regardless of size, but a character can use them immediately.

_Example: A readied dagger (5 sp) takes up a whole_ _inventory slot (1 st)._

Items can be packed away to save space. Readying a packed item for use takes at least one action.

_Example: Packed in a bundle, two daggers fit in a_ _single inventory slot._

Some equipment such as backpacks, pouches, purses, ammo belts, or clothing with hidden pockets can allow characters to pack away more gear than usual, effectively increasing their inventory.

_Example: Onion's synthetic skin backpack (1 st) allows_ _him to pack away and carry 3 stones worth of small_ _gear. Effectively, Onion can stuff 4 stones of items into_ _a single inventory slot. However, retrieving a specific_ _item from his backpack takes a whole action. Onion_ _had better not pack away his inquisition squirtgun if_ _he plans to use it._

##### 20

1 stone 10 (st) soaps

1 soap 25 (sp) cash

1 cash some (€) change

Significant item; a saber, spear, shield or shovel. About 7 kilograms or 15 pounds.

Small item; a signal whistle, signet ring, spike or bar of soap (surprisingly useful in the wastes!).

Standard currency unit equal to a laborer’s day wages. Named in a nod to ancient Chinese cash.

Unless otherwise specified, an item takes up 1 stone of inventory space.

250 cash units take up 1 stone. A PC's money is usually a mix of cards, credit, notes, and units that fit in a wallet.

Treat the wallet as part of their clothing.

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _20_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 021 -->

**Dropping Items** A character can quickly drop one item or pack as a free action on their turn, reducing any penalties suffered from encumbrance. A quickly dropped item may break, get damaged, roll away, or otherwise suffer the consequences. The referee chooses a save target.

_Example: A pair of shoes chucked onto a grassy slope_ _may roll downhill, a sack of stolen glass statuettes_ _dropped on a marble floor may produce a lot of sharp_ _glass caltrops._

A character taking an action to carefully drop an item or pack avoids any risk of damaging their precious property.

**Improvising With Items** Items are not just bundles of game mechanics. They improve a character’s performance and let them do new things. Use common sense and imagination to figure out how to take advantage of your PC’s equipment.

_Example: Rafts let characters float, while climbing_ _gear helps scale surfaces that are impossible to_

_free-climb._

**Human Clothes**

Baseline humans have evolved to wear clothes. Any garments suitable for a tropical or temperate climate that such a character wears take up no inventory slots. You can describe them on the back of the character sheet.

_Example: boiler suit, ship overalls, field loincloth,_

_civilian sarong._

Additional sets of clothes, or garments that provide benefits or modifiers, occupy inventory slots as usual.

_Example: a corporate suit (1 st) provides status benefits_ _and access to temples of finance, a classical toga (3 st)_

_blocks one arm and marks the wearer as a member of_

_the ruling class in some Decapolitan republics, nomad_ _robes (1 st) serve as armor, very warm clothes (2 st) are_

_useful in the domains of Winterwhite, an environment_

_suit (1 st) protects against radiation ghosts, etc._

Characters who are not evolved to wear clothes, such as cat lords, spectrum satraps, some golems, and other strange creatures, do not get a free inventory slot for the garments they wear.

_Example: a cat lord wearing a cute little jump suit (1 st)_ _and knit cap with foopy antennae (1 st) may not look_ _annoyed, but they can’t carry quite as many sacrificial_ _mouse victims as they might wish._

##### ONE STRANGE ITEM

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 023 -->

##### ONE USEFUL KIT

A kit is a packed bundle of mundane tools that let a character do their job. A settled character can use their kit to make a living.

You have **a kit for one of your background traits** . Draw a kit box on the back of your character sheet.

The kit measures a whole sack (10 stones) in heft and includes up to 10 individual items. You don’t need to choose in advance exactly what is in your character’s kit—the items are in a quantum superposition until you define them as you play.

_Example: Noë has a background as a plumber (don’t_ _ask) and starts with a plumber’s kit. Noë doesn’t list_

_each individual item in the kit._

_As she adventures, she produces useful O-rings, allen_ _wrenches, lengths of pipe, and sealing tape from her_ _kit. She lists these in her kit box, leaving space for 6_

_more quantum items._

The kit includes nothing better than a civilian weapon (1d6 damage) and no armor. You can buy more weapons and armor with your starting cash.

The starting kit leaves most characters burdened when unpacked. You can stash it before exploring a dangerous location or entering a fight. A beast of burden may help transport your kit.

→ _Now: get your starting cash (right)._

##### STARTING CASH

Many kinds of cash are possible: the traditional luminous cowrie of the coastal communities (lb), the high-end plastic Casino gold piece (cgp) of the Red Land District, the traditional bunker-era duraplastic chit (dpc) of the

Red and Orange Coprosperity Merchant Region, the sky-dragon scale (sds) of the Cat-affiliated knowledge societies, the prized ferroceramic puck-and-triangle of the Emerald City (fpck), and the completely ethereal noöspheric digital cash of the Dream Canopy (vdx).

For simplicity, the abstract “€” symbol covers them all.

You have **€50 + €50 per level** in physical currency. Enough to live on for a few months, if you are careful and boring. You’re not, though.

That's not much per level, honestly.

**What Cash Buys** Precisely how much €1 buys varies with place and time (and referee whim), but a reasonable baseline is 100 theoretical convertible imperial universal dollars from

Finite Earth A.D. 2025 to €1. Example purchases:

**Price** **Purchase** common meal or ingredient, €0.1 mass tourist souvenir day’s food and lodging for two proletarian €1 baseline humans, basic tool, uncommon ingredient, fancy meal day’s food and lodging for two mildly enhanced €10 bourgeois humans, professional tool, rare ingredient, opera ticket

€100 day’s food and lodging for two betterfolk aesthetically-augmented humans, rare or expert tool, very rare ingredients, basic vehicle, hut, small farm day’s food and lodging for two abmortal oligarchs, €1k uncommon vehicle, small cottage, middling farm hour’s rock-hitting trip for an imperial executive €10k unit, rare vehicle, comfortable residence, large farm or ranch

€100k [nearly super-heroic augment, ] luxurious residence, plantation abmortality, seat on the neo-imperial €1m shadow parliament, modest palace

A character can dream, right?

→ _Next: the remaining attributes (p24)._

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _23_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 024 -->

#### OTHER ATTRIBUTES

Your character is nearly complete! Just a few final attributes to figure out.

→ _Proceed in order._

##### LEVEL

An abstract measure of power. Some traits and items scale with levels.

You **start at level 1** and go to level 9.

Monsters and other NPCs range from level 0 to level 17. Some creatures by level to give a sense of scale:

0 rat, wretch, rabbit

1 human, horse, hagbird 2 soldier, snake-jake, river snapper 3 elite rider, king eland, electric hound 4 separatist hero, steppe wolf, sentinel golem 5 biomechanical queen, bloodosaur, broodmaker

6 epic nomad hero, hunter golem, skinchanger

10 bone roc, redmeatwood, house mimic

13 vome autofac, biomechanical catamaran

17 demiurge, void crawler, the Mother Machine

→ _Next: your life score (below)._

##### LIFE

Hylospheric persistence, hit points, embodiment? More like narrative resilience and plot armor. A measure of how long you’ll stay in action and a resource you spend to use your powers. Burn the candle at both ends.

Since you start at level 1, you **start with 8 life** .

PCs start with 4 life at level 0 and gain 4 life per level. Traits may grant more life. NPCs range from 4 life at level 0 to 666 life at level 17.

A character's life score cannot go below 0. A character reduced to exactly 0 life is in trouble, but not necessarily finished. If something would reduce a character below 0 life, they are reduced to 0 life and must roll on the defeat table (p60).

Death usually requires a conflict with deadly stakes, an accident (or critical success, i.e., a natural 20), or an additional killing blow. Even then, death is often not the end.

→ _Next: your hero dice (next page)._

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _24_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 025 -->

##### HERO DICE

Six-sided dice (d6) for adjusting rolls and regaining life. You gain one per session and one more every couple of hours. You can store HD equal to your most powerful PC’s level. The referee can grant more hero dice for inspired roleplaying and prosocial behavior like bringing milk and cookies to the game session.

Roll hero dice to do two things:

1. **Adjust any roll**, whether it is a d4 or a d20 or a d100. This does not have to be your roll. The adjusted roll counts as a natural roll. This is not an action.

2. **Regain life** equal to the roll. This is always an action.

Traits and items may provide other uses for hero dice. Rare traits can modify the number or type of hero dice. Burdens do not affect hero die rolls.

→ _Now: onward to note your saving throw target (below)._

##### SAVE

When nothing but blind luck will save you, roll d20 + ability over your saving roll target (or simply, your save). If you succeed, you are saved.

**Your save is 13.**

As with other rolls, there are three possible outcomes:

Under 13 **Doom** . What was, will be. No save.

Exactly 13 **Sacrifice** . Lose something precious to save. Over 13 **Save** . Disaster averted, fortune appeased.

**Relevant and Irrelevant Abilities**

- **Endurance** applies under duress, in harsh environ
ments, and against diseases or injuries.
- **Aura** applies against threats to psychic integrity, spiritual
pollution, daemonic possession, and mental injury.
- **Agility** does not provide a save bonus. As soon as a

character is aware of a threat, such as a landslide, it is no longer a blind luck situation. They are taking action, using traits and abilities to overcome a threat.

**Other Modifiers**

- **Wards** —oldtech artifacts or modern trinkets—usually
provide a bonus to saving rolls. Some provide a blanket
bonus to all saves, others only in certain circumstances.
- **Traits** can provide a bonus or modify a character’s saving
roll target.

→ _Next: attacks and defenses (p26)._

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _25_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 026 -->

##### DEFENSE

When you defend against an attack in the physical world the so-called hylosphere, foes must overcome your

**[physical] defense** attribute to hurt you.

**7 + ability** (agility) + **bonus** (if skill applies) + **armor**

Some specific attacks may have modifiers against mundane targets (which most PCs are).

_Example: Safir squares off against a malevolent_ _radiation ghost. Normally, Safir’s defense would be 18 (7_ _+ 3 (agility) + 3 (fighter trait) + 5 (chitin cuirass). Alas, the_ _radiation ghost’s gentle touch ignores physical armor,_ _so the target for its attacks is just 13._

**Armor** is modern equipment to soften blows or ancient machines replacing the body. Armor may give additional modifiers, benefits, penalties and mechanics.

_Example: many golem armors increase a character’s_ _ability score (usually strength) and give bonus life._

→ _Next: your attacks (right)._

**Option: More Defenses**

In some scenarios, the referee may bring other defenses into play. Players add defense boxes to their character sheet when required.

When your soul-mind duality ( _ka-ba_ ) travels like a butterfly between the dreams of diverse cosmic lords, plumbing the ancient noösphere, **mental defense** guards against injury in this realm as physical defense does in the base material cosmos. It may even apply in the base reality, if assailed by daemons or nightmares.

**7 + ability** (thought) + **bonus** (if skill applies) + **ward**

##### ATTACK

To attack, roll **d20 + ability + skill** **over defense** .

Each foe has a defense target number. When you beat it, you deal damage or otherwise impact their existence.

You have **four basic attack types** :

1. **Melee** - attack with a weapon, like a ghost bone axe or a machete.

d20 + ability (strength) + skill (if applicable) 2. **Ranged** - attack with a weapon, like a heat rod or a wand pistol. d20 + ability (agility) + skill (if applicable) 3. **Oldtech** - attack with an artifact, like a brain-slaved auto-turret.

d20 + ability (thought) + skill (if applicable) 4. **Fantascience** - attack with a power like a mind whip or brain shackle.

d20 + ability (charisma) + skill (if applicable)

→ _Now: your damage dice and modifiers (next page)._

**Wards** are metaphysical trinkets and magitechnical artifacts that protect one's non-physical integrity. They also often protect against spells.

When facing social challenges—whether fending off gossip, navigating legal battles, or competing in displays of wealth—you can use your **social defense** score.

**7 + ability** (charisma) + **bonus** (skill) + **prestige**

**Prestige** comes from status symbols—titles, properties, valuable possessions, and admired traits—that enhance influence in relevant settings. Prestige may help you convince a judge, motivate a rally, enchant a banker or charm a post-reality vidy star.

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _26_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 027 -->

##### DAMAGE

When an attack succeeds, you deal damage.

**dXX** (item)

**+ ability** (determined by traits) **+ bonus** (circumstantial)

Item descriptions list how much damage they do. Review your items and note their damage values.

Traits may let you add an ability score to your damage.

Powers and circumstances may provide additional damage bonuses.

**Improvised Damage** You can improvise a weapon from your environment or other equipment. Compare an improvised weapon to typical weapons to figure out how much damage you deal. The referee has final say.

**Typical weapon damages** and improvised weapons:

1. **Small personal weapon** (knife, 1d4 damage): a beer stein, throwing pan, oldtech mechanidoll, blast of alien poetry. 2. **Civilian weapon** (fire axe, 1d6 damage): a chair, fire extinguisher, electric trap, porcelain prince pheromones, doghead pack howl. 3. **Military weapon** (lance, 1d8 damage): a parking meter, water cannon, jury-rigged flash-blast mine, feline tele-empathetic mind control.

Traits can modify your improvised damage.

Improvised items have drawbacks. Fragile items break after landing a blow. Clumsy items penalize attack rolls.

Dangerous items can hurt the attacker.

→ _Proceeding: a quick inventory review (p28)._

**Unarmed Damage** If you have no suitable item for a type of attack, you can

[almost] always make an unarmed attack.

Your improvised or unarmed attack always deals at least **1d3 damage** .

Example unarmed attacks:

1. **Melee** - a punch, a kick, a head butt. 2. **Ranged** - a thrown clod, rock, or bar of soap. 3. **Oldtech** or other thought attack - a convenient trick, a subterfuge, a mechanical surprise. 4. **Fantascience** or other charisma attack - a terrifying boast, a harsh curse, an evil eye, a false incantation.

Traits can modify your unarmed damage.

##### INVENTORY

Your inventory slots are a key game resource. Though a character might want to carry everything, the cruel laws of their synthetic reality forbid it. Every human PC has three basic inventories.

- **Traits: 7 + thought slots**

- **Items: 7 + strength slots**

- **Burdens: 20 slots**

Non-humans may bear more or less.

_Example: a cute little cat lord PC has just 2 + ability_ _(strength) item inventory slots. They use a cat groom to_ _carry things for them._

Some traits may expand inventory slots.

**Pets and Sidekicks**

Each of a character’s pets and sidekicks occupies a trait or item inventory slot. This represents the character’s care and attention.

**Powers and Spells** Each power or spell occupies a trait or item inventory slot. This represents either a technomagical anchor or the engraved psychophysical channels that grant the character access to this unnatural power.

**Prosthetics and**

**Augments** Each implant or modification occupies a trait or item inventory slot.

**Additional**

**Inventories**

Traits and containers can create new sub inventories. For example, a high-quality singing Long Ago backpack.

Draw these on the character sheet or in a notebook.

##### BURDENS

Burdens are 20 special inventory slots for afflictions, traits, and items that are so difficult to bear that they impose penalties to your actions.

**Each burden imposes a -1 to all rolls** .

At 20 burdens, you can move or speak slowly and carefully, but can't take almost any other actions.

**Item and Trait Overflow**

If you run out of regular inventory slots for traits or items, you can store the excess among your burdens.

_Example: Onion is carrying his equipment (8 st) and an_ _armoire (10 st). With a strength of 1, he has 8 item slots._ _The armoire takes up ten burden slots, imposing a -10_ _penalty on all his rolls._

_Unwisely, or desperately, he tries to chase off a_ _ligneous skeleton (L1, corken) with a blast of hot_ _plasma from his wand-gun. He might still overcome_ _the penalty with his attack roll (a d20), but he may_ _well deal no damage (the plasma wand-gun deals d12_ _damage)._

_Still, even a glancing blast from the hot plasma might_ _frighten the ligneous skeleton. After all, cork burns so_ _well, does it not?_

**Afflictions**

Curses, diseases, mutations, corruptions, injuries, phobias, the impact of facing a true demon, and other afflictions occupy burden slots by default.

_Example: Fatigue (affliction) You are drained by your_

_exertions or the actions of an ill-daemon. Reduces_

_maximum life total by your level._

Such afflictions often impose additional penalties in addition to the standard -1 to all rolls.

Some spiritual and psychological afflictions may occupy trait slots instead, while diseases and physical injuries could occupy item slots at the referee's discretion.

**Removing Burdens** Dropping cumbersome items immediately removes that burden. Releasing the magitechnical formulae of powers or spells also immediately removes that burden. Removing other traits requires psychosurgery, shamanic intervention, or an increased thought score. Removing afflictions is harder, requiring rest and care.

#### LEVELING AND GROWTH

Heroes, like your main character, start their careers at level 1, because they are special. That means your PC **starts with**

**300 invested experience** .

##### EARNING EXPERIENCE

As you complete adventures, visit new places, see strange sights, and overcome harrowing challenges, you earn experience. Sources of experience include:

a. **Novelties.** When you explore, braving danger to see something new. Earn 1d6 x 10 xp per discovery or experience. b. **Quests.** When your PC makes progress on some terrible quest. Earn 1d6 x 100 xp per session’s worth of progress. c. **At the referee’s pleasure.** When you do something extraordinary, act in character, help the other players, and generally make the session memorable and fun. 1d6 x 10 per prosocial deed. d. **Session attendance.** At the end of a session, earn 500 xp for showing up and being a good egg.

The referee can set other sources of experience, such as:

e. **Scavengers.** Earn 1 xp per €1 of treasure recovered from an ancient ruin. f. **Pícaros.** Earn 1d6 x 100 xp after spending that much cash carousing for a week and risking strange setbacks.

→ _Next: so much for earning xp, now to spend them (next page)._

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _30_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 031 -->

##### INVESTING EXPERIENCE

All experience earned is banked until you invest it to level up a character(s), their pets and sidekicks, or their hallmarks. You can invest experience in other players’ characters, pets, sidekicks, and hallmarks, if they agree.

Each pet, sidekick, or other hallmark with invested xp occupies a trait or item slot on their owner PC's sheet.

**Investing in PCs** Your player character is also your main or primary character. PC is thus, conveniently, a double acronym.

**Every new level**, a PC chooses one: 1. gain **a new trait** of their choice (or a random trait), or 2. **improve a trait** of their choice (skilled +3 → expert +6 → master +9), or

3. **increase an ability score** by 1

Each level the PC also gains 4 life and 1 hero die.

**Xp** **Level** **Life** **Total Xp**

0 0 4 0

+300 1 8 300

+450 2 12 750

+750 3 16 1,500

+1,500 4 20 3,000

+3,000 5 24 6,000

+6,500 6 28 12,500

+12,500 7 32 25,000

+25,000 8 36 50,000

+49,999 9 40 99,999

**Investing in Pets and Sidekicks** These secondary characters start at level 0 unless specified otherwise. Leveling up secondary characters works exactly as with PCs.

After investing in a pet or sidekick, draw a box on the back of your main character’s sheet to track their experience, traits, and other attributes.

**Investing in Hallmarks** Any treasured possession can become a character’s hallmark—a vehicle, a sword, a power or something more unusual. Heroism rubs off on things.

A PC can own a number of hallmarks equal to their level.

All hallmarks start at level 0 unless specified otherwise.

Leveling them up costs experience, as with any other character, but also has material costs if it does not flow from in-game events (at the referee's discretion).

Each level, a hallmark gains an upgrade such as: 1. a **+1 bonus to every damage die** (so 2d4 becomes 2d4+2) at a cost of €5 per item level, or 2. a **+1 defense bonus** (so a shield’s bonus goes from +1 to +2) at a cost of €10 per item level, or

3. another **new trait, power or complication** such as the upgrades listed in the equipment section (p78).

_Example: Safir smashes the backup mind-soul jewel_ _of the deathless general of the City of Mirrors with_

_his accelerated hammer. The lich is now vulnerable,_

_should her physical avatar be destroyed._

_Safir levels up his hammer and gives it the lich-bane_ _trait (double damage against liches). Cat rules this_ _upgrade requires no additional materials._

**Shared Characters or Hallmarks**

If multiple PCs want to share ownership of a secondary character or item, for example the party's treasured house-golem, they should each write it down in an available slot on their character sheet.

**Recovering Invested Xp** Sometimes, despite a player's best intentions, their character or pet or hallmark suffers terminal existential failure—death or destruction.

Their owner recovers 50–100% (roll 1d6+4 x 10) of invested xp to their bank. If multiple players have invested xp, fair-minded owners are encouraged to repay the other investors as well.

→ _Overleaf: growing and changing through play (p32)._

> [@Vastlands_Guidebook, _p._ _31_]

<!-- Vastlands Guidebook, Page 032 -->

##### GROWING THROUGH PLAY

A PC’s goals are excellent material for the referee to tailor quests and adventures, providing some twists and turns.

**Gaining New Traits Through Play** Characters can gain traits without spending xp. Some may be acquired with careful study, others from strange ancient powers. In both cases, becoming skilled (or an expert or master) requires more in-game work.

1. Write down the new trait in a suitable inventory slot.

2. Figure out how many people and/or other sources you must study and absorb to acquire the skill (usually three to become skilled).

3. Each mentor, library, knowledge stone, or what-have-you is at a different location. Some sources may be found as treasures in the course of adventuring. 4. When you find a source, absorb its essence over one week of focused study (or meditation or bonding or mind surgery), then **roll thought to beat a target** **of 11** (a moderate thought roll). If you fail, you can try again after a further week of study. If you fail a second time, this teacher is not suitable for you. 5. After tallying three successes, your PC is skilled in the new trait.

Progress from skilled to expert requires 4–6 successes, and from expert to master 5–9 successes. Some traits may require more successfully absorbed sources.

The referee peppers sites and mentor NPCs around the map, creating a personalized quest.

_Example: Onion has observed the porcelain princes’_ _masterful crafting of masks and faces, and wishes to_ _become a facemaker, so he could create new faces for_

_himself and pass as other people with ease._

_The referee agrees this could be a worthy trait. The_ _first place to start learning about masks as faces_ _would obviously be the Porcelain Citadel. This is_ _enough of a hook for the player to write down the_ _facemaker trait, with space for three tallies._

_The referee consults their Grand Map. It will take_

_Onion at least 3 weeks of travel to reach the Porcelain_

_Citadel and look for a mentor. The search could take_

_another week and Onion's studies will take at least_

_one more week. With travel events and the other PCs'_ _shenanigans, that affords plenty of play time to seed_ _clues for future study locations Onion can research_

_and visit._

**Increasing Ability Scores** Traits, items, mutations, oldtech upgrades, and fantascience boons may permanently increase characters’ ability scores. Such artifacts make great treasures to motivate character quests.

**Adversity and Decay** Characters do not only become stronger. Age, injury, and magitechnical mishaps may bestow burdens and traits that wear them down. Curses, monsters, defeats and psychemagical travails may permanently reduce their ability scores.

The referee should be clear with players before their PCs take a course of action that may result in permanent injury. Permanent changes should be the result of risks freely taken by the player.

_Example: Noë dreams of becoming a terrible and_ _powerful wizard to prove to her mother that she is not_

_a failure._

_The referee provides rumors of an electrical brain_ _holding albums of great power, and Noë excitedly_ _pursues them. However, the more she learns of the_

_brain named Ata’ari, the clearer it becomes that the_

_price of ultimate mastery is the destruction of her_

_physical human body._

_Will she go this far? Or will she take some of her_ _knowledge and sell the rest to fuel new escapades?_

A referee may then provide quests to stave off a character’s inevitable decline and demise.

Alternatively, a player may decide to retire their character and promote a sidekick or create a new character. One option is to give the new character fewer xp than the lowest-level player character or the highestlevel available sidekick (whichever is less) at the table.

**You Are Ready**

You look about.

The grand phylakes rise atop their pylons; unbowed strangers, angels or demons, guardians or wardens, biomachines or demigods. Some are alive, some are undead, some are ruined. They are the stamp of civilization, the sign of the Garden, the boot that keeps out barbarism, war, and change. So say the administrator priests.

Here, on the fringe of the Vast, the peace fields are frayed, the thrum of history not quite stopped. No human patrol nor feline lord, no vegetable eye nor gentling bird. You are free, without prods or shackles to guide and help you (aside from the pesky daemon 'Player' murmuring in your head).

It is morning and the cat coffee is nearly brewed.

Share a thought with your fellow travelers, for soon you pitch headlong into turmoil and temptation, into the epic of adventure. As you travel and share stories over campfires, you may reveal more of yourself. Till then, this is enough.

**Begin.**
